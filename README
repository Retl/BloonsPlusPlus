Description: I've made some tweaks, fixes and modifications to the Bones dice bot Johnathan made and started 
wondering if other people have made any changes them selves.  So if there are any other people with sweet mods then I 
hope they find their way here and merge in their changes to this project.  It also proves to my group that the mods 
I've been making aren't to help me cheat ;)
