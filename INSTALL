			Install Instructions

	 Requirements:	Ruby 1.8
			Setup bones-go.rb by changing variables to your custom IRC names/servesr/channels.
			An IRC client

	  Run command:	ruby1.8 bones-go.rb 
			(from the directory with all the bones files)

	     Examples:	cd /home/dnd/BonesPlusPlus ; ruby1.8 bones-go.rb
			su - dnd -c 'screen -L -dmS dicebot bash -c "cd /home/dnd/dicebot ; ruby1.8 bones-go.rb"'
	
		Notes:

	Bones dice bot requires ruby 1.8.  When I first found the original bones project I attempted running it in the 
newest version of ruby (1.9.1 at current time) and that didn't fly, errors happened!  So the only trick to remember is 
make sure you have Ruby 1.8 installed and run bones through the ruby1.8 interpreter.  

	Ruby's website has pretty fantastic documentation about installing so I'll let it do most of the talking:

			http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/

	However obviously they're providing instructions for the latest version, make sure you grab the right installer.
for example, in Ubuntu you run `sudo apt-get install ruby1.8-full`.  I'm not afraid to admit I don't support windows 
well, if you're having problems getting ruby1.8 running on something besides linux you might try asking a site like 
stackoverflow.com or superuser.com for help.
